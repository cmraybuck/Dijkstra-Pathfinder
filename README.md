# Dijkstra-Pathfinder
Program that utilizes Dijsktra's Algorithm to determine the shortest-path from one destination to another via construction of a graph. Graph is constructed based on data from a text file (edges.txt).

After a successful run of the Dijsktra's algorithm, output.csv and path.txt will automatically be created. 

To access string lookup mode, type "/lookup" into the program terminal and press enter. You can now enter the name of any location located in edges.txt and the closest stop will be returned. 

If you rerun the code, make sure to delete the output.csv that was previously generated as to avoid duplicate column headers.
